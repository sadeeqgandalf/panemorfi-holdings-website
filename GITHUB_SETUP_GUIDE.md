# üö® GitHub Setup Fix Guide

## The Problem
Your Netlify build is failing because the code isn't actually in your GitHub repository. The error "Could not read package.json" means your repo is empty or the files didn't upload.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Properly Push Your Code

### Step 1: Check Your Local Setup
Open Command Prompt/Terminal in your project folder and run:
```bash
git status
```

### Step 2: If Git Isn't Initialized
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Panemorfi Holdings website"
git branch -M main
```

### Step 3: Add GitHub Repository
Choose ONE of these (try HTTPS first):

**Option A - HTTPS (Recommended):**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/sadeeqgandalf/panemorfi-holdings-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Option B - SSH (if you have SSH keys):**
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:sadeeqgandalf/panemorfi-holdings-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: If Remote Already Exists
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/sadeeqgandalf/panemorfi-holdings-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5: Verify Upload
1. Go to: https://github.com/sadeeqgandalf/panemorfi-holdings-website
2. You should see all your files including `package.json`
3. If empty, the push didn't work

## üÜò Alternative: Create New Repository

If the above doesn't work:

1. **Go to GitHub.com**
2. **Create new repository** (different name like `panemorfi-website-v2`)
3. **Use that new URL** in the git commands above

## üîç Troubleshooting

**If you get authentication errors:**
- Use GitHub Desktop app instead
- Or create a Personal Access Token

**If you're on Windows:**
- Use Git Bash instead of Command Prompt
- Or use GitHub Desktop

## ‚úÖ Success Check
Your GitHub repo should show:
- package.json
- src/ folder
- public/ folder
- All the website files

Once files are in GitHub, Netlify will automatically rebuild and your site will work!
